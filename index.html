                <h2 id="building-products-heading" tabindex="0">Building Products at Scale</h2>
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p tabindex="0">At PetoLab, I discovered how AI could transform traditional development workflows while building production systems serving many users. As the full-stack developer behind PetoKingdom's internal admin dashboard, I contributed to architecting comprehensive solutions that handle feature toggling, user analytics, team collaboration, and content moderation—all accelerated through strategic AI integration.</p>
                    
                    <p tabindex="0">My approach combines deep technical expertise with AI-powered development practices. I've built microservices with Spring Boot, containerized systems with Docker, and crafted responsive interfaces with React and React-Native—but what sets me apart is how I leverage AI to compress development timelines without compromising quality. This isn't about cutting corners—it's about focusing human creativity on architecture and user experience while AI handles the repetitive groundwork.</p>
                    
                    <p tabindex="0">Working alongside teams implementing production AI systems—from Two-Tower recommender architectures to LangChain-powered content feeds—gave me unique insights into how intelligent systems integrate with traditional development. This experience shaped my methodology: using AI not as a replacement for engineering excellence, but as a force multiplier that enables individual developers to deliver at the pace and quality of entire teams. The result? Faster shipping, fewer bugs, and more time spent on what matters—solving real user problems at scale.</p>

            <section class="story-section" aria-labelledby="ai-multiplier-heading">
                <h2 id="ai-multiplier-heading" tabindex="0">AI as a Force Multiplier</h2>
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p tabindex="0">While others debate if AI will replace developers, I've proven it makes us 3x more effective. My battle-tested approach transforms every phase of development: from initial architecture to production deployment.</p>
                    
                    <p tabindex="0">Take enterprise authentication—a feature that typically requires 3 weeks of research, implementation, and testing. Using Cursor AI for intelligent code generation, structured prompting for rapid Spring Security comprehension, and CodeRabbit for automated security reviews, I delivered a production-ready system with OAuth 2.0, JWT rotation, and comprehensive audit logging in just 5 days. This 3x acceleration isn't about shortcuts—the code passed the same rigorous security audits as traditionally-developed systems.</p>
                    
                    <p tabindex="0">My AI toolkit extends beyond code generation. Automated PR reviews catch 80% of issues before human review. AI-powered refactoring reduces technical debt continuously. Intelligent documentation generation keeps knowledge fresh and accessible. The compound effect: Our team ships features 70% faster while actually reducing production bugs by half.</p>
                    
                    <p tabindex="0">I help engineering teams adopt this approach pragmatically—starting with low-risk automation, measuring concrete improvements, then expanding to architecture and system design. The future isn't AI replacing developers; it's developers who master AI outperforming entire teams who don't.</p>

                <div class="story-text">
                    <p tabindex="0">At PetoLab, I learned that the best code means nothing if your team can't understand, maintain, and build upon it. By creating comprehensive onboarding documentation and initiating weekly knowledge-sharing sessions on AI-augmented development, I reduced new developer ramp-up time from weeks to days. More importantly, I helped traditional developers embrace AI tools—turning initial skepticism into enthusiasm as they saw their productivity soar.</p>
                    
                    <p tabindex="0">This focus on knowledge transfer and team enablement stems from a broader pattern in my career. Whether coordinating the 2024 IEEE ITSC conference with 200+ international technical experts, improving Google Maps accuracy for 100K+ users, or winning the University of Alberta's Graduate Community Engagement Award, I've consistently transformed complex ideas into accessible, actionable knowledge. These experiences taught me that the gap between good technology and great products is often bridged by someone who can translate between technical complexity and human needs.</p>
                    
                    <p tabindex="0">Today, I apply these skills to help engineering teams navigate the AI transformation. I don't just implement AI-powered solutions—I ensure every team member understands how to leverage these tools, why they work, and when traditional approaches still win. Because the future belongs to teams that combine human creativity with AI capabilities, not those that choose one over the other. And honestly? Nothing excites me more than watching a team discover they can build in hours what used to take days.</p>
